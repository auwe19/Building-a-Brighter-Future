      // 1. Design and build sustainable infrastructure for a better future
      val sustainableInfrastructure = "The key to a brighter future is designing and building sustainable infrastructure that can last for generations to come. This includes utilizing renewable resources, minimizing energy consumption, and using local materials and labor when possible. In addition, incorporating green building techniques, such as day-lighting with windows and skylights, can reduce the need for artificial lighting, and save energy."
      
      // 2. Use renewable energy sources like wind, water, and solar to power our future
      val renewableEnergySources = "Using renewable energy sources like wind, water, and solar to generate electricity is the cleanest and most efficient way to power our future. Renewable energy can provide a reliable source of energy with minimal emissions, and provide energy independence from the grid, as well as protect against future price increases. Additionally, utilizing renewable energy sources can help reduce the need for expensive and polluting fossil fuels, resulting in cleaner air and water."
      
      // 3. Increase efficiency through smart urban planning
      val smartUrbanPlanning = "Through smart urban planning, cities can become more efficient and interconnected, reducing the need for costly infrastructure projects and reducing traffic congestion. By focusing on sustainable transportation systems, public transportation, and walkable routes, cities can be connected in a way that encourages residents to move around without their own vehicles. Smart urban planning can also help conserve energy by promoting the use of high-efficiency buildings and homes, utilizing green spaces, and creating passive cooling solutions."
      
      // 4. Invest in green infrastructure
      val greenInfrastructure = "Investing in green infrastructure is another way to build a brighter future. Green infrastructure includes utilizing low-impact development, such as green roofs, permeable pavements, and rain gardens, which reduce stormwater runoff and help filter pollutants out of the environment. Additionally, investing in sustainable farming practices, such as composting, crop rotation, and integrated pest management, can reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, as well as create habitats for local wildlife."
      
      // 5. Encourage sustainable lifestyles
      val sustainableLifestyles = "Encouraging sustainable lifestyles can help build a brighter future by reducing energy consumption and promoting resource conservation. This includes utilizing renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, to reduce reliance on the grid and energy consumption. Additionally, educating people about the impact of their daily choices on the environment, such as eating organic food and utilizing public transportation, can help to reduce the consumption of natural resources and reduce waste."
